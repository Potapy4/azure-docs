Select **Build** to open a dialog. Then, select a folder to export the Xcode project.

When the export is complete, a folder will be displayed containing the exported Xcode project.

### Open the Xcode project

In the exported Xcode project folder, run the following command to install the necessary CocoaPods for the project:

```bash
pod install
```

Now your can open `Unity-iPhone.xcworkspace` to open the project in Xcode:

```bash
open ./Unity-iPhone.xcworkspace
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you see a `library not found for -lPods-Unity-iPhone` error, you likely opened the `.xcodeproj` file instead of the
> `.xcworkspace`. Open the `.xcworkspace` and try again.

Select the root **Unity-iPhone** node to view the project settings and select the **General** tab.

Under **Signing**, select **Automatically manage signing**. Select **Enable Automatic** in the dialog that appears to reset build settings.

Under **Deployment Info**, make sure the **Deployment Target** is set to `11.0`.

### Deploy the app to your iOS device

Connect the iOS device to the Mac and set the **active scheme** to your iOS device.
