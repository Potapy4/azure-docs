# Tutorial: Ingest data in Azure Data Explorer without one line of code

This tutorial will teach you how to ingest diagnostic and activity log data to an Azure Data Explorer cluster without one line of code. This simple ingestion method enables you to quickly begin querying Azure Data Explorer for data analysis.

In this tutorial you'll learn how to:
> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create tables and ingestion mapping in an Azure Data Explorer database.
> * Format the ingested data using an update policy.
> * Create an [Event Hub](/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-about)  and connect it to Azure Data Explorer.
> * Stream data to an Event Hub from [Azure Monitor diagnostic logs](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/diagnostic-logs-overview) and [Azure Monitor activity logs](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/activity-logs-overview).
> * Query the ingested data using Azure Data Explorer.

> [!NOTE]
> Create all resources in the same Azure location/region. This is a requirement for Azure Monitor diagnostic logs.

## Prerequisites

* If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.
* [An Azure Data Explorer cluster and database](create-cluster-database-portal.md). In this tutorial, the database name is *AzureMonitoring*.

## Azure Monitoring data provider - diagnostic and activity logs

View and understand the data provided by the Azure Monitoring diagnostic and activity logs. We will create an ingestion pipeline based on these data schemas.

### Diagnostic logs example

Azure diagnostic logs are metrics emitted by an Azure service that provide data about the operation of that service. Data is aggregated with time grain of 1 minute. Each diagnostic logs event contains one record. Following is an example of an Azure Data Explorer metric event schema, on query duration:

```json
{
	"count": 14,
	"total": 0,
	"minimum": 0,
	"maximum": 0,
	"average": 0,
	"resourceId": "/SUBSCRIPTIONS/F3101802-8C4F-4E6E-819C-A3B5794D33DD/RESOURCEGROUPS/KEDAMARI/PROVIDERS/MICROSOFT.KUSTO/CLUSTERS/KEREN",
	"time": "2018-12-20T17:00:00.0000000Z",
	"metricName": "QueryDuration",
	"timeGrain": "PT1M"
}
```

### Activity logs example

Azure activity logs are subscription level logs containing a collection of records. The logs provide insight into the operations performed on resources in your subscription. Unlike diagnostic logs, an activity logs event has an array of records. We will need to split this array of records later in the tutorial. Following is an example of an activity log event for checking access:

```json
{
	"records": [
	{
		"time": "2018-12-26T16:23:06.1090193Z",
		"resourceId": "/SUBSCRIPTIONS/F80EB51C-C534-4F0B-80AB-AEBC290C1C19/RESOURCEGROUPS/CLEANUPSERVICE/PROVIDERS/MICROSOFT.WEB/SITES/CLNB5F73B70-DCA2-47C2-BB24-77B1A2CAAB4D/PROVIDERS/MICROSOFT.AUTHORIZATION",

		}
	}]
}
```

## Set up ingestion pipeline in Azure Data Explorer 

The Azure Data Explorer pipeline setup contains various steps that include [table creation and data ingestion](/azure/data-explorer/ingest-sample-data#ingest-data). You can also manipulate, map, and update the data.

### Connect to Azure Data Explorer Web UI

1. In your Azure Data Explorer *AzureMonitoring* database, select **Query**, which will open the Azure Data Explorer web UI.

    ![Query](media/ingest-data-no-code/query-database.png)

### Create target tables

Use the Azure Data Explorer web UI to create the target tables in Azure Data Explorer database.

#### Diagnostic logs table

1. Create a table *DiagnosticLogsRecords* in the *AzureMonitoring* database that will receive the diagnostic log records using the `.create table` control command:

    ```kusto
    .create table DiagnosticLogsRecords (Timestamp:datetime, ResourceId:string, MetricName:string, Count:int, Total:double, Minimum:double, Maximum:double, Average:double, TimeGrain:string)
    ```

1. Select **Run** to create the table.

    ![Run Query](media/ingest-data-no-code/run-query.png)

#### Activity logs tables

Since the activity logs structure isn't tabular, you'll need to manipulate the data and expand each event to one or more records. The raw data will be ingested to an intermediate table *ActivityLogsRawRecords*. At that time, the data will be manipulated and expanded. The expanded data will then be ingested into the *ActivityLogsRecords* table using an update policy. Therefore, you'll need to create two separate tables for activity logs ingestion.

1. Create a table *ActivityLogsRecords* in the *AzureMonitoring* database that will receive activity log records. Run the following Azure Data Explorer query to create the table:

    ```kusto
    .create table ActivityLogsRecords (Timestamp:datetime, ResourceId:string, OperationName:string, Category:string, ResultType:string, ResultSignature:string, DurationMs:int, IdentityAuthorization:dynamic, IdentityClaims:dynamic, Location:string, Level:string)
    ```

1. Create the intermediate data table *ActivityLogsRawRecords* in the *AzureMonitoring* database for data manipulation:

    ```kusto
    .create table ActivityLogsRawRecords (Records:dynamic)
    ```

<!--
     ```kusto
     .alter-merge table ActivityLogsRawRecords policy retention softdelete = 0d
    <[Retention](/azure/kusto/management/retention-policy) for an intermediate data table is set at zero retention policy.
-->

### Create table mappings

 The data format is `json`, therefore, data mapping is required. The `json` mapping maps each json path to a table column name.

#### Diagnostic logs table mapping

Use the following query to map the data to the table:

```kusto
.create table DiagnosticLogsRecords ingestion json mapping 'DiagnosticLogsRecordsMapping' '[
{"column":"Timestamp","path":"$.time"},
{"column":"ResourceId","path":"$.resourceId"},
{"column":"MetricName","path":"$.metricName"},
{"column":"Count","path":"$.count"},
{"column":"Total","path":"$.total"},
{"column":"Minimum","path":"$.minimum"},
{"column":"Maximum","path":"$.maximum"},
{"column":"Average","path":"$.average"},
{"column":"TimeGrain","path":"$.timeGrain"}]'
```

#### Activity logs table mapping

Use the following query to map the data to the table:

```kusto
.create table ActivityLogsRawRecords ingestion json mapping 'ActivityLogsRawRecordsMapping' '[
{"column":"Records","path":"$.records"}]'
```

### Create update policy

1. Create a [function](/azure/kusto/management/functions) that expands the collection of records so that each value in the collection receives a separate row. Use the [`mvexpand`](/azure/kusto/query/mvexpandoperator) operator:

    ```kusto
    .create function ActivityLogRecordsExpand() {
        ActivityLogsRawRecords
        | mvexpand events = Records
        | project
            Timestamp = todatetime(events["time"]),
            ResourceId = tostring(events["resourceId"]),
            OperationName = tostring(events["operationName"]),
            Category = tostring(events["category"]),
            ResultType = tostring(events["resultType"]),
            ResultSignature = tostring(events["resultSignature"]),
            DurationMs = toint(events["durationMs"]),
            IdentityAuthorization = events.identity.authorization,
            IdentityClaims = events.identity.claims,
            Location = tostring(events["location"]),
            Level = tostring(events["level"])
    }
    ```

2. Add an [update policy](/azure/kusto/concepts/updatepolicy) to the target table. It will automatically run the query on any newly ingested data in the *ActivityLogsRawRecords* intermediate data table and ingest its results into *ActivityLogsRecords* table:

    ```kusto
    .alter table ActivityLogsRecords policy update @'[{"Source": "ActivityLogsRawRecords", "Query": "ActivityLogRecordsExpand()", "IsEnabled": "True"}]'
    ```

## Create an Event Hub Namespace

Azure diagnostic logs enable exporting metrics to a Storage account or an Event Hub. In this tutorial, we route metrics via an Event Hub. You'll create an Event Hubs Namespace and Event Hub for diagnostic logs in the following steps. Azure Monitoring will create the Event Hub *insights-operational-logs* for activity logs.

1. Create an event hub using an Azure Resource Manager template in the Azure portal. Use the following button to start the deployment. Right-click and select **Open in new window**, so you can follow the rest of the steps in this article. The **Deploy to Azure** button takes you to the Azure portal.

    [![Deploy to Azure](media/ingest-data-no-code/deploybutton.png)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2Fazure-quickstart-templates%2Fmaster%2F201-event-hubs-create-event-hub-and-consumer-group%2Fazuredeploy.json)

1. Create an Event Hub Namespace and an Event Hub for the diagnostic logs.

    ![Event Hub creation](media/ingest-data-no-code/event-hub.png)

    Fill out the form with the following information. Use defaults for any settings not listed in the following table.

    **Setting** | **Suggested value** | **Field description**
    |---|---|---|
    | Subscription | Your subscription | Select the Azure subscription that you want to use for your event hub.|
    | Resource group | *test-resource-group* | Create a new resource group. |
    | Location | Select the region that best meets your needs. | Create the event hub namespace in same location as other resources.
    | Namespace name | *AzureMonitoringData* | Choose a unique name that identifies your namespace.
    | Event hub name | *DiagnosticLogsData* | The event hub sits under the namespace, which provides a unique scoping container. |
    | Consumer group name | *adxpipeline* | Create a consumer group name. Enables multiple consuming applications to each have a separate view of the event stream. |
    | | |

## Connect Azure Monitoring logs to Event Hub

    | | |

1. Click **Create**  

## Query the new tables

You have a pipeline with data flowing. Ingestion via the cluster takes 5 minutes, by default, so allow the data flow for a few minutes before beginning to query.

### Diagnostic logs table query example

The following query analyzes query duration data from Azure Data Explorer diagnostic log records:

```kusto
DiagnosticLogsRecords
| where Timestamp > ago(15m) and MetricName == 'QueryDuration'
| summarize avg(Average)
```

Query results:

|   |   |
| --- | --- |
|   |  avg_Average |
|   | 00:06.156 |
| | |

### Activity logs table query example

The following query analyzes data from Azure Data Explorer activity log records:

```kusto
ActivityLogsRecords
| where OperationName == 'MICROSOFT.EVENTHUB/NAMESPACES/AUTHORIZATIONRULES/LISTKEYS/ACTION'
| where ResultType == 'Success'
| summarize avg(DurationMs)
```

Query results:
|   |   |
| --- | --- |
|   |  avg(DurationMs) |
|   | 768.333 |
| | |
