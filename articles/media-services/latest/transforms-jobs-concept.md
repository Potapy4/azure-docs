# Transforms and Jobs
 
Use [Transforms](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/media/transforms) to configure common tasks for encoding or analyzing videos. Each **Transform** describes a recipe, or a workflow of tasks for processing your video or audio files. A single Transform can apply more than one rule. For example, a Transform could specify that each video be encoded into an MP4 file at a given bitrate, and that a thumbnail image be generated from the first frame of the video. You would add one TransformOutput entry for each rule that you want to include in your Transform. You can create Transforms in your Media Services account using the Media Services v3 API, or using any of the published SDKs. The Media Services v3 API is driven by Azure Resource Manager, so you can also use Resource Manager templates to create and deploy Transforms in your Media Services account. Role-based access control can be used to lock down access to Transforms.

The Update operation on the [Transform](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/media/transforms) entity is intended for making changes to the description, or the priorities of the underlying TransformOutputs. It is recommended that such updates be performed when all in-progress jobs have completed. If you intend to rewrite the recipe, you need to create a new transform.

A [Job](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/media/jobs) is the actual request to Azure Media Services to apply the **Transform** to a given input video or audio content. Once the Transform has been created, you can submit jobs using Media Services APIs, or any of the published SDKs. The **Job** specifies information such as the location of the input video, and the location for the output. You can specify the location of your input video using: HTTPS URLs, SAS URLs, or [Assets](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/media/assets). The progress and state of jobs can be obtained by monitoring events with Event Grid. For more information, see [Monitor events using EventGrid](job-state-events-cli-how-to.md).

The Update operation on the [Job](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/media/jobs) entity can be used to modify the *description*, and the *priority* properties after the job has been submitted. A change to the *priority* property is effective only if the job is still in a queued state. If the job has begun processing, or has finished, changing priority has no effect.

The following diagram shows transforms/jobs workflow.

> [!NOTE]
> Properties of **Transform** and **Job** that are of the Datetime type are always in UTC format.

## Typical workflow

1. Create a Transform 
2. Submit Jobs under that Transform 
3. List Transforms 
4. Delete a Transform, if you are not planning to use it in the future. 

### Example

Suppose you wanted to extract the first frame of all your videos as a thumbnail image â€“ the steps you would take are: 

1. Define the recipe, or the rule for processing your videos - "use the first frame of the video as the thumbnail". 
2. For each video you would tell the service: 
    1. Where to find that video,  
    2. Where to write the output thumbnail image. 

A **Transform** helps you create the recipe once (Step 1), and submit Jobs using that recipe (Step 2).
